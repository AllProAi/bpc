# Development Process Rules for Bin-Picking Challenge
Copyright 2025, Daniel Hill dba Novus Nexum Labs (Daniel@allpro.enterprises)

## Development Lifecycle

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Create and review Product Requirements Document (PRD)
   - Develop Technical Design Document
   - Define implementation strategy and timeline
   - Set up GitHub repository and CI/CD pipeline

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Implement pose estimation algorithms
   - Develop data processing pipeline
   - Create visualization and debugging tools
   - Document code and algorithms

3. **Testing Phase**
   - Develop and execute test cases
   - Measure performance and accuracy
   - Identify and fix issues
   - Document test results

4. **Optimization Phase**
   - Profile code and identify bottlenecks
   - Implement performance optimizations
   - Balance accuracy and speed
   - Document optimization strategies

5. **Submission Phase**
   - Prepare final documentation
   - Create method description
   - Build final Docker image
   - Submit solution according to challenge requirements

## GitHub-Centered Workflow

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Configure GitHub repository
   - Set up GitHub Actions for Docker builds
   - Configure repository secrets
   - Establish branch protection rules

2. **Development Workflow**
   - Develop code locally without Docker
   - Commit and push changes to GitHub
   - Monitor automated builds in GitHub Actions
   - Review build logs and artifacts

3. **Branch Management**
   - Use `main` branch for stable code
   - Create feature branches for new implementations
   - Use pull requests for code review
   - Merge only tested and validated code

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Configure GitHub Actions workflow
   - Set up automated testing
   - Configure Docker image builds
   - Implement deployment to Docker Hub

## Documentation Requirements

1. **Planning Documentation**
   - All planning documents must be created before implementation
   - Planning documents must be reviewed and approved
   - Changes to requirements must be documented

2. **Implementation Documentation**
   - Code must be documented with docstrings
   - Algorithm descriptions must be created
   - Technical decisions must be documented
   - Update documentation as code evolves

3. **Testing Documentation**
   - Test plan must be created before testing
   - Test results must be documented
   - Performance and accuracy metrics must be recorded
   - Issues and limitations must be documented

## Quality Assurance

1. **Code Review Process**
   - All code must be reviewed before merging
   - Code must follow established style guidelines
   - Documentation must be reviewed for accuracy
   - Review comments must be addressed

2. **Testing Requirements**
   - All code must have appropriate tests
   - Unit tests must be run before commits
   - Integration tests must be run in CI/CD pipeline
   - Performance tests must be executed regularly

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Processing time must be monitored
   - Memory usage must be tracked
   - Accuracy metrics must be calculated
   - Optimization opportunities must be identified
