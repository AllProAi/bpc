# Bin-Picking Perception Challenge

This repository contains our solution for the Bin-Picking Perception Challenge (2025), focusing on robust 6DoF object pose estimation for industrial bin-picking applications.

## Challenge Overview

The Bin-Picking Perception Challenge tests the real-world robustness of 6DoF object pose estimation solutions. The competition uses Intrinsic's open-source datasets, metric methodologies, and the Flowstate work cell with a real robot to evaluate bin-picking tasks. The goal is to develop models that accurately estimate the position and orientation of objects in cluttered bin environments using the multi-view and multimodal Industrial Plenoptic Dataset (IPD).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)
- Docker
- ~1TB storage space for dataset and models

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone [repository URL]
   cd bin_picking_challenge
   ```

2. Set up the Python environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the dataset:
   ```
   python src/data/download_dataset.py
   ```

## Project Phases

Our development approach consists of the following phases:

1. **Environment Setup and Dataset Exploration** (Weeks 1-2)
   - Set up development environment
   - Download and analyze the IPD dataset
   - Explore dataset characteristics

2. **Baseline Implementation** (Weeks 3-4)
   - Implement baseline pose estimation model
   - Set up training pipeline
   - Create validation framework

3. **Advanced Model Development** (Weeks 5-8)
   - Implement and test multiple model architectures
   - Develop multi-view fusion techniques
   - Optimize for challenging cases

4. **Optimization and Refinement** (Weeks 9-11)
   - Optimize for both accuracy and speed
   - Implement post-processing techniques
   - Conduct comprehensive validation

5. **Final Integration and Submission** (Weeks 12-13)
   - Finalize model selection
   - Complete documentation
   - Prepare submission container

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `docs/` directory:

- **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**: Defines the project requirements, goals, and success criteria
- **Development Plan**: Outlines the technical approach, timeline, and resource allocation
- **Implementation Checklist**: Tracks progress on specific implementation tasks

## Model Architecture

Our solution is based on [briefly describe architecture when decided]. It utilizes multimodal fusion of RGB and depth data across multiple viewpoints to accurately estimate 6DoF object poses in cluttered bin environments.

Key features include:
- Multi-view integration
- Attention mechanisms for feature learning
- Geometric consistency enforcement
- Confidence-based pose refinement

## Submission Format

The final submission consists of a Docker container that implements the required API endpoints for the challenge evaluation system. The Docker configuration and submission instructions are available in the `docker/` directory.
