Copyright 2025, Daniel Hill dba Novus Nexum Labs (Daniel@allpro.enterprises)

## Required Documentation

1. **Planning Documents**
   - Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Detailing project goals and requirements
   - Development Plan - Outlining implementation strategy and timeline
   - Technical Design Document - Describing technical approach and architecture
   - Testing Strategy - Defining testing approach and success criteria

2. **Implementation Documents**
   - Algorithm Documentation - Explaining pose estimation approaches
   - Performance Analysis - Analyzing runtime and accuracy metrics
   - Integration Guide - Explaining how components interact
   - Configuration Guide - Detailing configuration options and parameters

3. **Submission Documents**
   - Method Description - Summarizing the approach for competition submission
   - Results Analysis - Analyzing performance on validation datasets
   - Limitations and Future Work - Documenting known limitations and future improvements

## Documentation Format Standards

1. **Markdown Files**
   - Use Markdown for all documentation files
   - Follow a consistent structure across documents
   - Include a table of contents for longer documents
   - Use proper headings, lists, and code blocks

2. **Embedded Documentation**
   - Use Google-style docstrings for Python code
   - Document all parameters, return values, and exceptions
   - Include examples where appropriate
   - Keep docstrings up to date with implementation changes

3. **Visual Documentation**
   - Include diagrams for complex systems or workflows
   - Add visualizations of pose estimation results
   - Use consistent styling for all visual elements
   - Reference all visual elements in the text

## Documentation Process

1. **Documentation First Development**
   - Create documentation before implementation
   - Update documentation as code evolves
   - Ensure documentation remains accurate and complete
   - Review documentation with the same rigor as code

2. **Version Control**
   - Store documentation in version control
   - Update documentation with each significant code change
   - Tag documentation versions corresponding to code versions
   - Include rationale for major changes

3. **Review and Approval**
   - Review documentation for accuracy and completeness
   - Address all feedback before finalization
   - Ensure documentation meets quality standards
   - Get final approval before submission

## Specific Documentation Requirements

1. **Algorithm Documentation**
   - Explain the pose estimation pipeline in detail
   - Document all preprocessing steps
   - Describe feature extraction and object detection methods
   - Detail pose estimation algorithms and refinement techniques

2. **Performance Documentation**
   - Document runtime performance with profiling results
   - Analyze accuracy metrics (MSSD, mAP)
   - Compare different approaches and their trade-offs
   - Document optimization strategies

3. **User Documentation**
   - Provide clear instructions for running the code
   - Document environment setup requirements
   - Include troubleshooting information
   - Provide examples of expected inputs and outputs
