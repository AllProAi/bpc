## Testing Requirements

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Write unit tests for all critical functions
   - Test core algorithms independently
   - Ensure at least 80% code coverage
   - Document testing methodology

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test the pose estimator with the tester module
   - Verify compatibility with the evaluation pipeline
   - Test with all supported object types
   - Document integration test results

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Measure processing time per scene
   - Ensure processing time is under 35 seconds
   - Profile code to identify bottlenecks
   - Document performance metrics

4. **Accuracy Testing**
   - Evaluate pose estimation accuracy using MSSD
   - Calculate mAP across MSSD thresholds
   - Compare against baseline solutions
   - Document accuracy metrics

## Testing Process

1. **Test Planning**
   - Create a comprehensive test plan
   - Define test cases for all requirements
   - Establish acceptance criteria
   - Document testing strategy

2. **Test Execution**
   - Execute tests locally for code verification
   - Run integration tests via GitHub Actions
   - Document test results and issues
   - Update tests when requirements change

3. **Test Automation**
   - Automate unit tests for continuous integration
   - Configure GitHub Actions for test execution
   - Include testing in CI/CD pipeline
   - Generate test reports automatically

4. **Test Analysis**
   - Analyze test results to identify issues
   - Track performance and accuracy metrics
   - Compare results across iterations
   - Document findings and improvement opportunities

## Testing Guidelines

1. **Test Data Management**
   - Use the provided training and validation datasets
   - Create specific test cases for edge conditions
   - Document test data usage and coverage
   - Ensure test data is representative

2. **Test Documentation**
   - Document test cases and scenarios
   - Record test results and metrics
   - Document known issues and limitations
   - Update documentation with each test cycle

3. **Error Handling Testing**
   - Test error handling and recovery
   - Verify graceful failure for invalid inputs
   - Test resource cleanup and memory management
   - Document error handling behavior

4. **Edge Case Testing**
   - Test with multiple occluded objects
   - Test with varying lighting conditions
   - Test with objects at scene boundaries
   - Document edge case behavior

## Evaluation Metrics

1. **Primary Metrics**
   - MSSD (Maximum Symmetry-Aware Surface Distance)
   - mAP (mean Average Precision) across MSSD thresholds
   - Processing time per scene

2. **Secondary Metrics**
   - Memory usage
   - CPU/GPU utilization
   - Detection rate for different object types
   - Robustness to occlusion

3. **Testing Tools**
   - Use the provided tester module for validation
   - Implement custom visualization tools for debugging
   - Use profiling tools for performance analysis
   - Document tools and methodologies
