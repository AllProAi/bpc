**April Total: 20 submissions**

## Strategic Reserves
**Reserved submissions: 10**

These reserved slots provide flexibility for:
1. Unexpected discoveries requiring immediate validation
2. Rapid iteration on highly promising approaches
3. Emergency fixes for critical issues
4. Final optimizations before the Testing Phase

## Learning Maximization Strategy

### Documentation System
- **Pre-submission checklist**: Complete before each submission
- **Post-submission analysis**: Document within 2 hours of results
- **Submission log fields**:
  - Submission ID and timestamp
  - Approach description (model, loss, confidence mechanism)
  - Key changes from previous submission
  - Performance metrics (mAP, per-threshold AP, inference time)
  - Observations and insights
  - Action items for next iteration

### Parallel Validation
Between official submissions, conduct extensive local validation using:
- Cross-validation on training data
- Synthetic test cases for edge scenarios
- Performance profiling for memory and compute
- Ablation studies on key components

### Submission Pairing Strategy
When using 2 submissions per day:
- **First submission**: Test a new approach or significant change
- **Second submission**: Rapid iteration based on first submission results
- Minimum 4-hour gap between paired submissions to allow for analysis

### Diversity vs. Convergence
- **Weeks 1-3 (Mar 11-31)**: Explore diverse approaches to identify promising directions
- **Weeks 4-5 (Apr 1-14)**: Converge on top-performing methods with focused iterations
- **Week 6 (Apr 15-21)**: Fine-tune best approaches for maximum performance

## Final Submission Preparation (April 19-21)
- Run extensive validation on final candidate models
- Verify memory usage and inference time on L4-equivalent hardware
- Ensure robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Prepare comprehensive documentation for submission

## Testing Phase Strategy (April 21-May 2)
- Use our single submission wisely, based on all learnings from Development Phase
- Focus on generalization to new objects rather than peak performance on known objects

## Total Submission Count
- March: 20 submissions
- April: 20 submissions
- Reserved: 10 submissions
- **TOTAL: 40 planned + 10 reserved = 50 maximum**
